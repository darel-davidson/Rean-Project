How I would have used Ansible:

However here is an outline of my second plan:
1.1 Create EC2 Instance, Configure EC2 to create an instance with also installing ansbile 
1.2 Or use a specific cloudformation to have ansible already installed.
2. Automatically download github playbooks to user EC2 instance.
3. Have the user execute the ELK.yml playbook, which should trigger installation of Jenkins. 
4. Once Jenkins is installed the user can kick off the job to install ELK.

Defects:
1. Longstash yml not completed.
2. Did not test ELK.yml nor Kibana.yml
3. I was not able to connect to git hub from EC2 instance, to download and test plays. 
4. I did not configure the Ansible script to automatically handle user requested input.

Java check and install plays:
Play to check which version of java is currently installed if less than 1.8:
 a. sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
 b. sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --config java
 c. '2'
    --Example -> Check Java version.
