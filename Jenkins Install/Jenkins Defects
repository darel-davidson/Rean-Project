How I would have used Jenkins
I struggled with getting Jenkins to connect to EC2 instance once being installed. 
Which prevented this plan from coming to fruition however here is an outline of my first plan:
  1. Install Jenkins on EC2 instance manually by running install commands. 
    -- I believe this could have been automated through EC2, however I was not able to configure that.
  
  2. Use Jenkins to connect to EC2 instance. 
    -- Did not configure. I wanted to use Jenkins to connect to EC2, followed by ansible being installed. 
    -- Jenkins would then execute ELK installation on the EC2 instance.
    
  3. Create a job in Jenkins to install ansible.
  4. The same job would also use pre-created ansible playbooks to install ELK on each instance the user asks to be created.
